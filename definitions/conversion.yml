  title: Nexmo Conversion API
  version: 1.0.2
  description: >-
    The Conversion API allows you to tell Nexmo about the reliability of your
    2FA communications. Sending conversion data back to us means that Nexmo can
    deliver messages faster and more reliably.

    The conversion data you send us is confidential: Nexmo does not share it
    with third parties.

    In order to identify the carriers who provide the best performance, Nexmo
    continually tests the routes we use to deliver SMS and voice calls. Using
    Adaptive Routingâ„¢, Nexmo actively reroutes messages through different
    carrier routes and ensures faster and more reliable delivery for your
    messages. The route choice is made using millions of real-time conversion
    data points.
